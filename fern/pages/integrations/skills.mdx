---

## Getting started

AgentMail provides an official skill that can be installed on AI coding assistants and agents that support the [AgentSkills](https://skills.sh) format. This includes Moltbot, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and other compatible tools.

The skill is available at [skills.sh/agentmail-to/agentmail-skills/agentmail](https://skills.sh/agentmail-to/agentmail-skills/agentmail).

## Installation

### Moltbot

Install the skill using the Moltbot CLI:

```bash
moltbot skills install agentmail-to/agentmail-skills/agentmail
```

Or install via ClawdHub:

```bash
clawdhub install agentmail
```

### Claude Code

Add the skill to your Claude Code configuration:

```bash
claude-code skills install agentmail-to/agentmail-skills/agentmail
```

### Cursor

Install the skill in Cursor:

```bash
cursor skills install agentmail-to/agentmail-skills/agentmail
```

### Manual installation

You can also manually clone the skill repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentmail-to/agentmail-skills.git ~/.skills/agentmail
```

## Configuration

After installation, configure your AgentMail API key. The method varies by platform:

### Environment variable

Set the `AGENTMAIL_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export AGENTMAIL_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Moltbot configuration

Add the API key to `~/.clawdbot/moltbot.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "agentmail": {
        "enabled": true,
        "env": {
          "AGENTMAIL_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Get your API key from the [AgentMail Console](https://console.agentmail.to).

## Features

The official AgentMail skill provides comprehensive email functionality:

### Inboxes

Create scalable inboxes on-demand. Each inbox has a unique email address that your AI agent can use to send and receive emails.

### Messages

Send emails with both plain text and HTML content for best deliverability. The skill handles proper formatting and headers automatically.

### Threads

Threads group related messages in a conversation, making it easy to follow email chains and maintain context across multiple exchanges.

### Attachments

Send and receive attachments with Base64 encoding. The skill can retrieve attachments from messages or threads.

### Drafts

Create drafts for human-in-the-loop approval before sending. This is useful when you want to review emails before they go out.

### Pods

Multi-tenant isolation for SaaS platforms. Each customer gets isolated inboxes, perfect for building email-enabled applications.

### Idempotency

Use idempotency keys for safe retries on create operations. This prevents duplicate emails when network errors occur.

### Real-time events

The skill supports both WebSockets (persistent connection, no public URL needed) and webhooks (HTTP-based notifications) for real-time email notifications.

## Example usage

Once installed, you can ask your AI assistant to perform email tasks:

- "Create a new email inbox for my project"
- "Send an email to john@example.com about the meeting tomorrow"
- "Check my inbox for new emails"
- "Reply to the latest email from Sarah"
- "Create a draft response to the support ticket"
