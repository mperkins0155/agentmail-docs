Webhooks are the best way to get real-time information about what's happening with your emails. Instead of constantly asking the AgentMail API if there's a new email (a process called polling), you can register a URL, and we will send you a `POST` request with the details as soon as an event happens.

This event-driven approach is more efficient and allows you to build fast, responsive agents that can react instantly to incoming messages.

## Why Use Webhooks?

- **Real-Time Speed:** Build conversational agents that can reply to incoming emails in seconds.
- **Efficiency:** Eliminates the need for constant polling, which saves you computational resources and simplifies your application logic.

## The Webhook Workflow

The process is straightforward:

<Steps>
    <Step title="1. Create a Webhook Endpoint">
        This is a public URL on your server that can accept `POST` requests. For local development, a tool like `ngrok` is perfect for creating a secure, public URL that tunnels to your local machine. Your endpoint should immediately return a `200 OK` response to acknowledge receipt and process the payload in the background to avoid timeouts.
    </Step>
    <Step title="2. Register the Endpoint with AgentMail">
        You can register your URL using the AgentMail API. When you create a webhook, you'll specify your endpoint's URL as well as event types you want to receive.

        <CodeBlocks>
        ```python
        client.webhooks.create(
            url="https://<your-ngrok-url>.ngrok-free.app/webhooks"
        )
        ```
        ```typescript
        await client.webhooks.create({
            url: "https://<your-ngrok-url>.ngrok-free.app/webhooks",
        });
        ```
        </CodeBlocks>
    </Step>
    <Step title="3. AgentMail Sends Events">
        When a new message is received in one of your inboxes, AgentMail will immediately send a `POST` request with a JSON payload to your registered URL.
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Payload Structure

When AgentMail sends a webhook, the payload will have the following structure.

```json Webhook Payload
{
  "event_type": "message.received",
  "event_id": "evt_123abc...",
  "message": {
    "from_": ["sender@example.com"],
    "organization_id": "org_abc123...",
    "inbox_id": "inbox_def456...",
    "thread_id": "thd_ghi789...",
    "message_id": "msg_jkl012...",
    "labels": ["received"],
    "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z",
    "reply_to": ["reply-to@example.com"],
    "to": ["recipient@example.com"],
    "cc": ["cc-recipient@example.com"],
    "bcc": ["bcc-recipient@example.com"],
    "subject": "Email Subject",
    "preview": "A short preview of the email text...",
    "text": "The full text body of the email.",
    "html": "<html>...</html>",
    "attachments": [
      {
        "attachment_id": "att_pqr678...",
        "filename": "document.pdf",
        "content_type": "application/pdf",
        "size": 123456,
        "inline": false
      }
    ],
    "in_reply_to": "msg_parent456...",
    "references": ["msg_ref1...", "msg_ref2..."],
    "sort_key": "some-sort-key",
    "updated_at": "2023-10-27T10:00:05Z",
    "created_at": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- **`event_type`** (`string`): The name of the event. Currently, this will always be `message.received`.
- **`event_id`** (`string`): A unique identifier for this specific event delivery.
- **`message`** (`object`): A dictionary containing the full details of the received email message.
  - **`from_`** (`array<string>`): The sender's email address. Note the trailing underscore to avoid conflict with the Python keyword.
  - **`organization_id`** (`string`): The ID of your organization.
  - **`inbox_id`** (`string`): The ID of the inbox that received the message.
  - **`thread_id`** (`string`): The ID of the conversation thread.
  - **`message_id`** (`string`): The unique ID of this specific message.
  - **`labels`** (`array<string>`): Labels associated with the message (e.g., `received`, `sent`).
  - **`subject`** (`string`): The subject line of the email.
  - **`preview`** (`string`): A short plain-text preview of the email body.
  - **`text`** (`string`): The full plain-text body of the email.
  - **`html`** (`string`): The full HTML body of the email, if present.
  - **`attachments`** (`array<object>`): A list of attachments, each with its own `attachment_id`, `filename`, `content_type`, `size`, and `inline` status.
  - **`in_reply_to`** (`string`): The `message_id` of the email this message is a reply to, if applicable.
