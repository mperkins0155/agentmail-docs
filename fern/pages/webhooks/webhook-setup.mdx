This guide walks you through the complete process of setting up webhooks to receive real-time notifications from AgentMail. You'll learn how to create an ngrok account, set up an inbox, configure webhooks, and write a simple webhook receiver.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- An [AgentMail API Key](https://docs.agentmail.to/quickstart#step-3-create-an-api-key)
- `pip` package manager
- Basic familiarity with Python and terminal commands

## Installation

First, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install agentmail flask ngrok
```

## Step 1: Setting up account on Ngrok

Ngrok creates a secure tunnel from a public URL to your local development server, allowing AgentMail to send webhooks to your machine during development.

### 1.1 Create an ngrok account

Visit [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/) and click "Sign up" to create a free account.

### 1.2 Choose your platform and install

After logging in, ngrok will guide you through the setup process. Select your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

<img src="../../assets/webhook-system.png" alt="Ngrok setup instructions" />

For macOS, you can install ngrok via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ngrok
```

After installation, authenticate ngrok with your authtoken (found in your ngrok dashboard):

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN
```

## Step 2: Creating the inbox on AgentMail

Before you can receive webhooks, you need an inbox to receive messages. Create one using the AgentMail API:

```python
from agentmail import AgentMail

client = AgentMail()

# Create an inbox for your webhook agent
inbox = client.inboxes.create(
    username="webhook-demo",
    client_id="webhook-demo-inbox"  # Ensures idempotency
)

print(f"Inbox created: {inbox.inbox_id}")
```

The `client_id` parameter ensures that running this code multiple times won't create duplicate inboxes. If the inbox already exists, it will return the existing one.

## Step 3: Configuring webhook on AgentMail

### 3.1 Start ngrok tunnel

In your terminal, start an ngrok tunnel to expose your local server (we'll use port 3000):

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

You should see output similar to this:

<img src="../../assets/webhook-console.png" alt="Ngrok terminal output" />

Copy the **Forwarding URL** (e.g., `https://your-subdomain.ngrok-free.app`). This is the public URL that AgentMail will use to send webhooks.

<Callout intent="info" title="Use localhost for testing">
When viewing your webhook receiver in the browser, use the `http://127.0.0.1:3000` URL shown in the "Web Interface" line, not the ngrok URL. The ngrok URL is only for external services like AgentMail.

**Why localhost?** Safari is stricter than Chrome/Firefox when viewing development servers through HTTPS ngrok tunnels. Safari blocks local WebSockets and some dev-only scripts, which causes the page to show a loading spinner indefinitely due to Hot Module Replacement (HMR). This is expected development behavior and not a documentation issue. Using localhost or static builds avoids this problem.
</Callout>

### 3.2 Register webhook with AgentMail

Now register your webhook endpoint with AgentMail:

```python
# Using the ngrok URL you copied
webhook_url = "https://your-subdomain.ngrok-free.app/webhooks"

webhook = client.webhooks.create(
    url=webhook_url,
    client_id="webhook-demo-webhook"  # Ensures idempotency
)

print(f"Webhook created: {webhook.webhook_id}")
```

## Step 4: Code example for receiving webhooks

Create a file named `webhook_receiver.py` with the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, Response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    """Status page to verify server is running"""
    return """
    <html>
    <body style="font-family: sans-serif; max-width: 800px; margin: 50px auto; padding: 20px;">
        <h1>AgentMail Webhook Receiver</h1>
        <div style="background: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 10px 20px;
                    border-radius: 4px; display: inline-block; margin: 20px 0;">
            Server is running
        </div>
        <div style="background: #e3f2fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 4px;
                    border-left: 4px solid #2196F3;">
            <h3>Webhook Endpoint Ready</h3>
            <p>Your webhook endpoint is listening at: <code>POST /webhooks</code></p>
        </div>
        <h3>How to use:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Start ngrok: <code>ngrok http 3000</code></li>
            <li>Register your webhook with AgentMail using the ngrok URL</li>
            <li>Send a test email to your AgentMail inbox</li>
            <li>Watch the console for incoming webhook events</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
    </html>
    """

@app.route('/webhooks', methods=['POST'])
def receive_webhook():
    """Receives webhook events from AgentMail"""
    payload = request.json

    event_type = payload.get('event_type')
    message = payload.get('message', {})

    print(f"\nWebhook received: {event_type}")
    print(f"From: {message.get('from_')}")
    print(f"Subject: {message.get('subject')}\n")

    return Response(status=200)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Starting webhook receiver on http://127.0.0.1:3000")
    app.run(port=3000)
```

### Running your webhook receiver

1. Make sure ngrok is running in one terminal window
2. In another terminal, run your webhook receiver:

```bash
python webhook_receiver.py
```

3. Send a test email to your AgentMail inbox
4. Watch the console output for incoming webhook events

### Viewing the result

Open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:3000` to see the status page confirming your webhook receiver is running:

<img src="../../assets/webhook-result.png" alt="Webhook receiver status page" />

## Testing Your Setup

To test your webhook setup:

1. Send an email to your inbox address (e.g., `webhook-demo@agentmail.to`)
2. Check your webhook receiver's console output
3. You should see the webhook event details printed immediately

<Callout intent="success" title="Next Steps">
Now that your webhook is working, you can extend the `receive_webhook()` function to:
- Automatically reply to messages
- Process attachments
- Route emails to different handlers based on content
- Integrate with your AI agent workflows

Check out the [Event-Driven Agent Example](/webhook-agent) for a more advanced implementation.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook not receiving events">
    - Verify ngrok is running and the forwarding URL matches your webhook registration
    - Check that your Flask app is running on the correct port (3000)
    - Ensure your webhook URL ends with `/webhooks`
    - Look for errors in both the Flask console and ngrok web interface
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ngrok tunnel disconnects">
    Free ngrok accounts have 2-hour session limits. The tunnel will disconnect and you'll need to restart ngrok and update your webhook URL with AgentMail.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Port already in use">
    If port 3000 is already in use, choose a different port:
    - Change the port in `app.run(port=XXXX)`
    - Update the ngrok command: `ngrok http XXXX`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Production Considerations

For production deployments:

- **Use a dedicated server**: Deploy your webhook receiver to a cloud service (AWS, GCP, Heroku, etc.) instead of using ngrok
- **Implement webhook verification**: [Validate incoming requests](/webhook-verification) are authentically from AgentMail
- **Add error handling**: Implement retry logic and error reporting
- **Use async processing**: Return 200 immediately and process webhooks in background jobs
- **Monitor webhook health**: Set up logging and alerting for failed webhook deliveries
