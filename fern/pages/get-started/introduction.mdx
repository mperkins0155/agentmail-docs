## What is AgentMail?

AgentMail is an API platform for giving AI agents their own inboxes to send, receive, and act upon emails. We handle the infrastructure so you can focus on building email agents.

**Email agents** can:

- Have conversations with users in their inboxes
- Automate email-based workflows for enterprises
- Authenticate with third party applications
- Act as first-class users on the internet

## The Problem with Traditional Email

Existing email infrastructure was built for humans. Legacy providers such as Gmail and Outlook have several limitations for agentic use cases:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="No API for Inboxes" icon="fa-solid fa-link-slash">
    Legacy providers lack API support for creating new inboxes on-demand.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Per-Inbox Pricing" icon="fa-solid fa-dollar-sign">
    They charge monthly subscriptions per inbox($12/inbox/month !!), which is
    costly for agents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Restrictive Limits" icon="fa-solid fa-ban">
    They impose restrictive rate and sending limits not suitable for automation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Poor DX" icon="fa-solid fa-face-frown">
    Overall, they offer a poor developer experience for building on top of
    email. The Gmail API sucks!
