## What is an Inbox?

People are used to the traditional Gmail limitations -- only having one inbox. That's of the past.

An `Inbox` is now a fully loaded, programmatically accessible API resource re-designed for the scale of AI Agents.

Think of it as being similar to a Gmail or Outlook account, but built API-first. Each `Inbox` has a unique email address and serves as the primary resource your agent uses to send and receive emails, giving it a first-class identity on the internet.

Unlike traditional email providers that are designed for human scale, AgentMail `Inboxes` are built to scale horizontally. You can create tens, hundreds, or even thousands of `Inboxes` for your agents on demand.

<Tip>
  Psst! Rather than sending 1000 emails from 1 `Inbox`, sending 10 emails
  across 100 `Inboxes` actually improves deliverability! Read more about
  optimizing for deliverability [here](/best-practices/email-deliverability)
</Tip>

### The AgentMail Hierarchy

As the diagram below illustrates, your `organization` is the top-level container that holds all your resources. You can provision many `Inboxes` within your `organization`, each with its own `Threads`, `Messages`, and `Attachments`, allowing you to manage a large fleet of agents seamlessly.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Organization">
    Your `organization` is the highest-level entity. It acts as a container for
    all your `Inboxes`, `Domains`, and API keys, allowing you to manage
    everything in one place.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inbox">
    An `Inbox` is a single, scalable "email account" for your agent. You can
    create thousands of `Inboxes` within your organization, each with its own
    unique email address.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Thread">
    A `Thread` represents a single conversation. It groups together all replies
    and forwards related to an initial email, keeping your interactions
    organized.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Message">
    A `Message` is an individual email. It contains the content, sender,
    recipients, and any associated metadata or `Attachments`. You can cc humans
    at any point in time to keep a "human-in-the-loop"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attachment">
    An `Attachment` is a file that is sent along with a `Message`. You can
    programmatically access and download attachments from incoming `Messages`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Core Capabilities

Here at AgentMail we've now made an `Inbox` an API resource, meaning you can perform standard CRUD operations on it. Here are the core capabilities you'll use to manage your `Inboxes`.

<CodeBlocks>

```python
from agentmail import AgentMail

# Initialize the client
client = AgentMail(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# --- Create an Inbox ---
# Creates a new inbox with a default agentmail.to domain
new_inbox = client.inboxes.create()
print(f"Created Inbox: {new_inbox.inbox_id}")

# --- Retrieve an Inbox ---
# Gets a specific inbox by its ID
retrieved_inbox = client.inboxes.get(inbox_id = 'my_name@domain.com')
print(f"Retrieved Inbox: {retrieved_inbox.inbox_id}")

# --- List Inboxes ---
# Lists all inboxes in your organization
all_inboxes = client.inboxes.list()

print(f"Total Inboxes: {all_inboxes.count}")

```

```typescript title="TypeScript"
import { AgentMailClient } from "agentmail";

// Initialize the client
const client = new AgentMailClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

// --- Create an Inbox ---
// Creates a new inbox with a default agentmail.to domain
const newInbox = await client.inboxes.create({
  username: "docs-testing",
  domain: "domain.com",
  displayName: "Docs Tester",
});
console.log(`Created Inbox: ${newInbox.id}`);

// --- Retrieve an Inbox ---
// Gets a specific inbox by its ID
const inboxId = newInbox.id;
const retrievedInbox = await client.inboxes.get(inboxId);
console.log(`Retrieved Inbox: ${retrievedInbox.inbox_id}`);

// --- List Inboxes ---
// Lists all inboxes in your organization
const allInboxes = await client.inboxes.list();
console.log(`Total Inboxes: ${allInboxes.count}`);



```

</CodeBlocks>

<Tip>
  When creating an `Inbox`, the `username` and `domain` are optional. If you
  don't provide them, AgentMail will generate a unique address for you using our
  default domain. Check out our [guide on managing
  domains](/guides/domains/managing-domains) to learn more.
